In This article, we would be implementing Queue data structure in javascript. A Queue works on the FIFO(First in First Out) principle. Hence, it performs two basic operations that is addition of elements at the end of the queue and removal of elements from the front of the queue. Like Stack, Queue is also a linear data structure.

Note: Assuming a queue can grow dynamically we are not considering the overflow condition
