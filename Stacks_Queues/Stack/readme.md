In this article, we would be implementing Stack Data Structure in Javascript. Stack is a very useful data structure and has a wide range of application. Stack is a linear data structure in which addition or removal of element follows a particular order i.e. LIFO(Last in First Out) AND FILO(First in Last Out).
Note : Assuming the stack can grow dynamically we are not considering the overflow condition.
